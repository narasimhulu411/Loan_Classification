Description of the dataset:
This data set includes customers who have paid off their loans, who have been past due and put into collection without paying back their loan and interests, and who have paid off only after they were put in collection.

Objective :
To build a model which predicts whether the loan is paid off, in collection, new customer yet to payoff, or paid off after the collection efforts.

Constraints :
1.Acceptable with little latency.

2.Need good Exploratory Data Analysis.

3.The cost of a mis-classification can be very high

Type of Machine Learning Problem :
Muliticlass Classification

Performace Metrics :
Try with as many as possible metrics.

1.Accuracy

2.F1 score

3.Confusion Matrix
